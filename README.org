* Seeds

This is a simple library that intends to make it convenient to create
new projects or modules from the REPL, in order to quickly test out
new ideas ("seeds"). It is built on top of Quickproject.

Add the following (modify as necessary) to your lisp init file to load
the library and set up default values. Ideally ASDF should be set up
to scan the seed directory for ASD files.

: (require :seeds)
: 
: (setf seeds:*seed-directory* "/home/user/lisp/seeds/"
:       seeds:*seed-template-directory* "/home/user/lisp/seed-templates/"
:       seeds:*depends-on* '(:alexandria)
:       seeds:*default-template* :basic)

Example: 

Assume we have our templates set up like this:

:  seed-templates/
:    basic/
:      system.asd
:      application.lisp
:    cli-app/
:      ...
:    web-app/
:      ...

Then calling

~(seeds:create-seed "foo" :template :basic)~ 

will create a new project called "foo" in our seed directory. The
project can be moved elsewhere later if it turns out to be useful or
deleted if it didn't work out.

The result would look like this:

:  seeds/
:    foo/               * (created)
:      foo.asd          * (created)
:      foo.lisp         * (created)
